# Forethoughts #
Jekyll is not as intuitive to start with as I initially thought  
Some HTML/CSS/Liquid editing is required *in addition* to Markdown

To render a page locally, installing Ruby is required

# Getting Started 

- Download ruby
- Steal gems
- bundle

# Setup to display properly on local host #

## Render locally
`bundle exec jekyll serve`  
bundle - ?  
exec - ?  
jekyll - ?  
serve - ?  

Also, just running `jekyll serve` re-renders as well

Yet, this doesn't mean that the serve needs to be restarted when changes are made...
